      "description": "The Security Aspect of the Government Enterprise Architecture Reference (GEAR) Logical View integrates protection mechanisms such as encryption, intrusion detection, and threat mitigation across all layers of the architecture. It ensures that all parts of the enterprise are safeguarded against evolving threats by embedding security measures into the Organizational, Process, and Physical Layers. This approach enables a resilient, policy driven environment capable of addressing diverse threats across every architecture layer"
